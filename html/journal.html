  <P>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:"P
    assing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."
  </P>
  <blockquote>
    Passing cars,<br>
    When you can't see,<br>
    May get you,<br>
    A glimpse,<br>
    Of eternity.<br>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I definitely won't be passing any cars.

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed 
    and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot 
    with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials.
    As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
